To avoid these issues, always include thorough error checking and handle potential exceptions gracefully.  Use `class_getInstanceMethod` or `class_getClassMethod` with care, checking for nil return values before attempting any swizzling.  Ensure you have a mechanism to restore the original method implementation if necessary and handle selector issues appropriately.

```objectivec
// Correct method swizzling with error handling
Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(originalMethod));
if (originalMethod) {
    Method swizzledMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(swizzledMethod));
    if (swizzledMethod) {
        method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod);
    } else {
        NSLog("Error: Swizzled method not found.");
        // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., fallback behavior)
    }
} else {
    NSLog("Error: Original method not found.");
    // Handle the error appropriately (e.g., fallback behavior)
}
```

This improved version checks for the existence of both methods before attempting the exchange.  It also includes error logging which provides better debugging support.  Remember to add appropriate error handling for your specific needs and application context.
