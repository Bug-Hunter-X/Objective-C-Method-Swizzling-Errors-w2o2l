In Objective-C, a subtle issue can arise when dealing with method swizzling if you don't handle potential exceptions or edge cases properly.  For example, if you try to swizzle a method that doesn't exist, your application might crash unexpectedly.  Another common mistake is forgetting to restore the original method implementation after your swizzling is complete, leading to unexpected behavior later. Improper handling of selectors can also lead to problems.  Using a nil selector or attempting to use a selector that belongs to a different class could cause your application to behave strangely or crash. Consider this scenario:  

```objectivec
// Incorrect method swizzling
Method originalMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(originalMethod));
Method swizzledMethod = class_getInstanceMethod([MyClass class], @selector(swizzledMethod));
method_exchangeImplementations(originalMethod, swizzledMethod);
```

This code doesn't check if `originalMethod` or `swizzledMethod` is actually found before attempting the swizzling. This omission can lead to crashes.
